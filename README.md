Files for the python intro meeting.  

- Log.txt - Full of events collected from my Honeypot, and will be used in both the Python Basics and a Demo scripts (Demo being sent out closer to the meeting)
- PythonBasics.py file - Opens in any text browser and is full of information about the language, including links to the Python 2.7.7 download and how to set up your Python environment.

Once you have your environment configured, you can run the basics script and see it in action!

1. Start with PythonBasics.py
2. Try to solve the challenges in Py_Challenges.py
3. Have fun!
